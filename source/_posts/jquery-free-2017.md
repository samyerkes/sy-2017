That’s right, I’m pledging to not use any jQuery in 2017, in favor of Vue.js!

I’ve been messing around with Vue for a few months off and on, but still have a ton learn. I’m excited to get into writing components and more complicated frontend code. I believe it will really help put some polish on the applications I’m working on.
