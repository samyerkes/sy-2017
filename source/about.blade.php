    <p>As embarrassing as it may sound, Sam started his journey into web development designing a web presence and gig posters for his high school punk band. After figuring out becoming a rock star wasn't going to work as a career path, he started studying a quieter profession - learning how to write basic HTML elements and photoshopping his friends' heads on to celebrities' bodies.</p>
    
    <p>Fast forward a few years - during his time attending Virginia Tech, Sam started to get serious about web design and digital media. He would often stay up late into the night working on top secret side projects. His current interests include distributed infrastructure and object oriented programming.</p>

    <p>Sam recently graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) with a Master of Science degree in Information Systems. Sam also has a Post-Baccalaureate Graduate Certificate in Business Administration from VCU and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Virginia Tech.</p>
    
    <p>At <a href="http://www.vcu.edu/">VCU</a>, Sam works as the University Webmaster. He currently lives and works in Richmond, Virginia with his wife and her cat.</p>
